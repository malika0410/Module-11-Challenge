## Time Series forcasting on MercadoLibre E-commerce website.

I've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, I want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.
Following are the steps to perform the analysis and forcasting.

- Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

- Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

- Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

- Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

- Step 5 (optional): Forecast revenue by using time series models
